## Implementation

### Tech Stack

Frontend:Javascript, React, CSS
Backend: Node, Express, Motoko

### APIs

To develop a comprehensive NFT marketplace,there are two primary components: the NFT products themselves and a digital currency (token) that can be used within the platform for transactions.

### Sitemap

For a comprehensive NFT marketplace, having distinct pages dedicated to discovery, minting, and user-owned NFTs (MyNFTs) is essential for a seamless user experience. Below is an overview of the purpose and key features for each of these pages: 1. Discover Page: To allow users to explore and discover NFTs available for purchase or auction on the platform. 2. Minting Page: To provide creators and artists with a simple and intuitive interface for creating (minting) new NFTs. 3. MyNFTs Page: To enable users to view and manage their own NFT collection, including items they've created, bought, or are currently selling.
